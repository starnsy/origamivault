# 🔐 OrigamiVault — Encrypted Paper Storage

**“Like writing your secret (e.g. master password) on paper — but only your loved ones can read it in case of emergency or death.”**

OrigamiVault is a tiny offline web app for **encrypting or splitting secrets** and printing them as **QR codes** and **OCR-friendly recovery JavaScript**. 

👉 **Live app:** https://starnsy.github.io/origamivault/

Nothing is uploaded or stored online — everything runs locally in your browser.

Perfect tool for strategic recovery of **master passwords**, **crypto keys**, **2FA seeds**, **recovery phrases**, and **digital legacy planning**.

## ✨ Why Paper?

Digital storage fails. Devices get hacked. Devices break, drives die, accounts get locked. 

Paper, stored safely, can last for decades.

## 🔐 Example Use Case: Emergency Recovery in case of death

A simple way to ensure your loved ones can recover your master password **without exposing it to anyone else**:

1. **Split your secret** (e.g. master password) into two halves.  
2. Use OrigamiVault to **encrypt the first half** with an encryption password and print the encrypted paper.  
3. **Handwrite the second half** of the secret on the same paper.  
4. Give the **encryption password** to trusted friend A.  
5. Tell trusted friend B **where the printed paper is stored** — or give them a copy.  
6. In an emergency, **friends A and B cooperate** to recover your secret.

**Why it’s safe**

- **Thief finds paper?** Only encrypted text + half a password → useless.  
- **Hacker gets encryption password + ciphertext?** Only half a password → still useless.  
- **Trusted people collaborate?** They recover the full master password.

✅ **Result:** No single point of failure — but recovery is possible when it truly matters.
