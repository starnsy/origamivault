# OrigamiVault — Encrypted Paper Storage

**Offline. Secure. Printable. Recoverable.**

OrigamiVault is a tiny web app for encrypting sensitive data and storing it on paper using QR codes or OCR-friendly printed code.
Nothing is uploaded or stored online. Everything runs locally in your browser.

👉 **Live app:** https://origamivault.github.io/origamivault/

👉 **Video Demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzQkq5Qjri8

Perfect for backing up **master passwords**, **crypto private keys**, **2FA seeds**, **recovery phrases**, and **emergency access information**.

## ✨ Why OrigamiVault?

Digital storage fails. Password managers break. Hard drives die. Cloud accounts lock you out.

Paper lasts for decades.

OrigamiVault lets you:

- Create **encrypted**, durable paper backups
- Store them safely in a drawer, safe, or envelope
- Share the password + location with someone trusted (digital legacy)
- Restore using nothing but a browser — even years later

Simple. Durable. Open-source.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Encrypt**  
   Enter your secret and a password. OrigamiVault encrypts it using AES-GCM.

2. **Print**  
   Choose between:

   - **Encrypted QR code**, or
   - **OCR-friendly JavaScript snippet**  
     (contains the encrypted payload + tiny decryption logic)

3. **Store**  
   Keep the printed page somewhere safe.

4. **Decrypt**
   - Scan the QR code **or**
   - OCR the JS snippet and paste it in a browser  
     Then enter your password to reveal the original message.

Everything runs locally. No servers involved.

## 🧾 Dual Backup Format: QR Code + OCR-Friendly Text

OrigamiVault gives you **two independent long-term recovery methods**, designed for durability and future-proofing.

### 1. Encrypted QR Code

- Fast to scan with any phone
- Compact and easy to print
- Works offline

### 2. Printable JavaScript Decryption Snippet

OrigamiVault also prints a **self-contained JS snippet**, including:

- The encrypted payload
- A minimal decryption function
- Instructions for restoring your secret

This means your data stays recoverable even if:

- QR scanners stop working
- The print is damaged
- Cameras can’t capture the code cleanly
- Future technology changes formats

### OCR-Optimized Typography

The printed snippet uses **Azeret Mono**, one of the most OCR-accurate monospaced fonts, chosen because:

- Characters are highly distinguishable
- OCR engines read it with minimal error
- Glyph ambiguity is minimized (0/O, l/1, etc.)
- Prints crisply on low-quality printers

This ensures that even **decades from now**, your encrypted backup remains readable and decryptable.
