# OrigamiVault - encrypted paper storage via QR codes

[A simple web app](https://declegacy.github.io/origamivault/) for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data using AES, and storing it with QR code technology on the paper. With this stragegy, nothing is ever stored online.

## Sample Usage

Safely store your encrypted passwords or recovery keys in a drawer, ensuring that no one with physical access can retrieve your sensitive information.

You can share the encryption password and the location of the paper storage with someone you trust, giving them the option to retrieve your sensitive data in case of death or emergency.

## How It Works

1. **Encrypt**: Enter your secret message and a password to generate an encrypted QR code
2. **Share**: Share the QR code image with anyone
3. **Decrypt**: Scan the QR code with your phone camera and enter the password to reveal the message

## Features

- 🔒 AES-GCM 128-bit encryption using Web Crypto API (no external dependencies)
- 📱 QR code generation and scanning
- 🚀 No server required - runs entirely in the browser
- 🔐 Password-protected decryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- 💾 Works completely offline - no CDN dependencies for encryption

## Redundancy

This app is mirrored across multiple platforms for reliability:

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/declegacy/origamivault
- **GitLab**: https://gitlab.com/declegacy/origamivault

You can also save the app locally (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S) to decrypt content even when both platforms are offline.

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser or visit the live app at: https://declegacy.github.io/origamivault/
